"Coding Part of the exercise" Photo Manager

<<Goals of the project>>
Design a program in Java programming language and in desktop IntelliJ environment that will perform the following:
* The User will be able to select an existing profile or create his own new profile (he will enter his code and username. This information will be stored on a xml or Json file)
* The program will allow the users to create groups of management data about his photos so that Photo Manager becomes a personalized tool (each user will have his owm 'database' for saving photos and he will be able to manage his photos {example select multiple photos,de-select multiple photo, mass/individual deleting of pictures)
* It will allow the user to insert search filters to locate and view photos related to meta-data that he has inserted 
* It will allow the user to make entry of meta-data on selected photos
* It will allow the user to browse photos (a 'default' pic will be displayed before the user inserts any data on the filters. Also, when the user's inserted data on filters doesnt match with any picture's meta-data then a 'no result found' picture will be displayed on the display area)

**NOTES
**The text inside the () is my comments
**There will be 6 databases, one for each user
**Each database must be a xml or Json file
**Each database will contain only the paths of the photos and the meta-data of the photos
**The Program will accept only 6 profiles in total

*Try to limit the use of libraries that need to be downloaded and inserted manually 
*No FxJava libraries
*Dont forget to improve the GUI
*Meta-data is the picture's details given by the user

example
when the user inserts the filters:  red    keyboard
pictures with these meta-data will be displayed 


************** Below are my instructions for the buttons*****************

1) Profile.Form -> User can select or create new profile   ****Rename it to "SelectionScreenProfile.Form"****

Button1 to Button6 -> Select an existing profile or create a new one
Button7 (Background Swap)-> Background Changer
*idea* a button under every profile which it will delete your profile -> Resets your Profile
Field View1 -> Show Time Clock
Field View2 -> Show Current Date

2) UserData.Form -> The user assigns the category of the filters he wishes and he has the ability to see/assign his personal identifying information
***This Form opens when you create your profile

Label1 to label5 -> The user's personal identifying information are displayed
Label6 to Label9 -> User defined filters are displayed

3) Profile1_Gadget.Form -> Pre-existing form where the user is a customer and searches for electronic items in existing photos through filters

In the "Profile.Form" the user has the ability of the following actions:

The Buttons are the same as those of the 'Profile1_Gadget Form' but the filters and meta-data arent inserted. The User will insert his own
